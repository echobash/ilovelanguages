Basic Introductory Sentences in all the languages spoken around the world at one place.

Steps to contribute in the repo and add the pharases for a language -

1. Make a new folder for the language you wish to add (e.g spanish) 
2. In the folder, create a file named language.txt (e.g spanish.txt)
3. In the spanish.txt, add the translation of these basic sentences in that particular langauge along with the orignal sentences in english-
